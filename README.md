This website does not let you screenshot the images displayed on it, it will detect if you open the console (using devtools-detect) and hide the images. I know you can see the requests from the network tab or view the page source but I don't know how to hide the images from there. I know I can make a separate server for the images but that's just a lot of extra work because of how I made this.
